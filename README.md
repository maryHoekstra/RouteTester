# RouteTester

RouteTester is an iOS app that collects GPS coordinates from a user and presents custom memory tests using Google Street View images.
RouteTester is being designed as a research study for the POPMEM Computational Memory Lab at Queen's University, Kingston. Apple's ResearchKit framework is being used to obtain informed consent, collect demographics information, and present the memory test.
